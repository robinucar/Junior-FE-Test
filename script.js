//question4



//get request with react. firstly i installed axios.
// Axios is promise-based, which gives you the ability to take advantage of JavaScriptâ€™s async and await for more readable asynchronous code.
//then I created state object which has persons empty array.
//and then inside componentDidMount lifecycle method i send get request to api. 
//then i created a persons variable and equalize to response data. 
// then i pushed persons inside the state.
//in the end i used data inside jsx.


//important:  in the functional components we use useEffect hooks instead of componentDidMount. And Also we use useState Hooks to define our states. 

///classbase component
import React from 'react';

import axios from 'axios';

export default class PersonList extends React.Component {
  state = {
    persons: []
  }

  componentDidMount() {

//question 5

//A JavaScript Promise object contains both the producing code and calls to the consuming code

//common promise syntax: 
let myPromise = new Promise(function(myResolve, myReject) {
    // "Producing Code" (May take some time)
    
      myResolve(); // when successful
      myReject();  // when error
    });
    
    // "Consuming Code" (Must wait for a fulfilled Promise)
    myPromise.then(
      function(value) { /* code if successful */ },
      function(error) { /* code if some error */ }
    );

    /**Promises are the ideal choice for handling asynchronous operations in the simplest manner. 
     * They can handle multiple asynchronous operations easily and provide better error handling than callbacks and events. 
     * 
     * Benefits of Promises
            Improves Code Readability
            Better handling of asynchronous operations
            Better flow of control definition in asynchronous logic
            Better Error Handling
